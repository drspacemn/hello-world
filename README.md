My first repository in GitHub

My name is Ben Goebel, I am starting an adventure as a Cyber Pirate, which begins with learning the local languages. Here is a small poem I wrote:

An Ode to Code

		  How sweet the code
		  The ones the Os
	
		  The bits and bites
		  And keys and mice
		
		  Machines with minds
		  And ticking times
		  
Thanks all for now
